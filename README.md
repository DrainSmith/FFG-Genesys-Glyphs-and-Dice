#### FAQ:

Q: Why are the characters smooshed up like that?  
A: That is something called "overprint" that is used in the printing process.  Most may not use it, but I assure you the glyphs work as intended.  They add a border around the previous character and are intended to add emphasis.  It is not a feature common to many text editors.

Q: What is the layout of the symbols?
A:
  * Hollow Diamond (overprint): J
  * Hollow Hexagon (overprint): K
  * Hollow Square (overprint): L
  * Advantage: a
  * Despair: d
  * Failure: f
  * Threat: h
  * Solid Square: j
  * Solid Diamond: k
  * Solid Hexagon: l
  * Success: s
  * Triumph: t
